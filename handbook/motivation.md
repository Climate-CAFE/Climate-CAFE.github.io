# Motivation

Welcome to our data management system's Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). This document outlines a comprehensive process tailored for climate and health researchers to seamlessly submit their data to our consortium's data management system. Our primary objective is to facilitate consistent and high-quality data submissions that precisely align with the specific needs of researchers specializing in biostatistics, epidemiology, and environmental and public health.

## Identifying Key Aspects

We understand that data collection in the context of our Consortium for Advancing Research on Climate and Health (CAFE) involves intricate considerations. To kickstart this endeavor, we will begin with an internal first iteration. This initial phase serves as a foundation for the development of an external SOP.

## Setting Basic Assumptions and Definitions

To ensure the usefulness of this first iteration, we establish a set of fundamental assumptions and definitions that encapsulate the user base and their requirements. These initial assumptions will guide our decision-making process as we progress toward building a comprehensive external SOP.

Please note that these assumptions and definitions are subject to expansion and modification based on the insights and feedback gathered during the initial survey.

## User Base and Journals

Our target user base comprises climate and health researchers hailing from departments of biostatistics, epidemiology, environmental studies, and public health. These dedicated researchers often contribute to renowned journals in their respective fields, including but not limited to:

- BMC Public Health
- Environmental Epidemiology
- American Journal of Public Health
- Environmental Research
- American Journal of Epidemiology
- Epidemiology
- Biometrics
- Biometrica
- Journal of Public Health

## Addressing User Needs

Understanding the needs of our users is pivotal to the success of our data management system. Researchers engaged in ecological and epidemiological studies often rely on tabular datasets that necessitate spatial and temporal alignment. Consequently, users invest significant time and resources into data processing tasks such as spatial aggregation, temporal extrapolation/interpolation, and the creation of crosswalks.

Despite the availability of numerous open datasets, our users' needs remain unmet by existing data providers and repositories such as Dataverse, Earth Data, or SEDAC. This is primarily because:

- Datasets with exact matching space and time units are challenging to locate.
- Repositories typically lack the code required to transform raw data into analysis-specific versions.
- The most pertinent datasets for climate and health research are not easily consolidated within a single repository.
- Some datasets may present size constraints or computational challenges, potentially hindering their usage or causing delays, even for data-savvy users.

Our SOP aims to bridge these gaps and provide climate and health researchers with a streamlined data submission and access process, ultimately advancing research in these critical fields.
