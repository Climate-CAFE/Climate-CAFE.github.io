# Welcome to the BUSPH-HSPH CAFE RCC Documentation Site 

This is the documentation website for [CAFE](https://climatehealthcafe.org/), the Research Coordinating Center for Health and Extreme Weather based at Boston University School of Public Health and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. CAFE aims to build a Community of Practice by managing and supporting health and extreme weather research and capacity building efforts.

 
The CAFE data management objective is to aid climate and health community of practice by identifying health and extreme weather research data needs, defining common data elements, developing and promoting data science and software tools for processing data, and providing data management and dissemination guidance. 

### CAFE Data Sharing 

Harvard Dataverse is an open source generalist data repository where we are amassing a collection of commonly-used climate and health data and linkages, including spatial data. Following FAIR principles, we strongly encourage the community of practice to help expand the Climate-Health CAFE Dataverse collection by contributing data for sharing and reuse. 

### CAFE Tutorials and Code Sharing

We have established a community GitHub organization to share code, examples, and tutorials on working with common data formats and sources. We are assembling a collection of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for data processing, integration, harmonization, and analysis with code and tutorials in order to facilitate reproducibility and reusability for the climate and health Community of Practice. We encourage community members to contribute, share, and reuse code and software within the Climate-CAFE GitHub organization. Code and tutorials will include tasks such as spatial aggregations, data harmonization, and analysis across languages including R and Python and platforms such as ArcGIS.
