# Welcome to the Climate CAFÉ Data Management Page 

The BUSPH-HSPH Climate Change and Health Research Coordinating Center ([CAFÉ](https://climatehealthcafe.org/)) aims to build a Community of Practice by managing and supporting climate change and health research and capacity building efforts.

 
The CAFÉ data management objective is to aid climate and health community of practice by identifying climate and health research data needs, defining common data elements, developing and promoting data science and software tools for processing data, and providing data management and dissemination guidance. 

CAFÉ Climate Health Data Sharing 

Harvard Dataverse is an open source generalist data repository where we are amassing a collection of commonly-used climate and health data and linkages, including spatial data. Following FAIR principles, we strongly encourage the community of practice to help expand the Climate-Health CAFÉ Dataverse collection by contributing data for sharing and reuse. 

Climate & Health Tutorials and Code Sharing

We have established a community GitHub organization to share code, examples, and tutorials on working with common data formats and sources. We are assembling a collection of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for data processing, integration, harmonization, and analysis with code and tutorials in order to facilitate reproducibility and reusability for the climate and health Community of Practice. We encourage community members to contribute, share, and reuse code and software within the Climate-CAFÉ GitHub organization. Code and tutorials will include tasks such as spatial aggregations, data harmonization, and analysis across languages including R and Python and platforms such as ArcGIS.
